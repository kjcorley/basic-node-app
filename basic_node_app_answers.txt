>What is a Node module?

A node module is a set of functions to be included in an application.

>What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

`module.exports` is the variable that gets returned from require(), while `exports` is a reference to `module.exports`.

>Why is using exports recommended?

`exports` is recommended unless the module is intended to be a specific object type.  Reassignment of the variable `exports` does not affect previously assigned properties using `exports`.
